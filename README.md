## About the game
In Blast Chamber, you must complete the level before the room explodes. To complete the level, you must collect the various cards scattered around the level. To do this you must jump from platform to platform whilst avoiding bombs on the platforms. This action platformer incorporates pixel art graphics with unique mechanics that will keep you engaged as you try to outpace the relentless countdown clock. Can you collect all the cards in time before the chamber collapses? Play Blast Chamber now to find out!

Blast Chamber is a 2D side-scroller platformer, developed in Unity as part of the Expressive Game Design module for my BSc Games Programming degree.
